      <description>The Use of Numpy in Python.
One of the main benefits of R is that comes ready with built in functions. For example, helpful functions like matrix ops, trig functions, and graphics all come with R. Python, another important coding language, does not come with many of these built in functions. However, it is a very common language and so it would be useful if there was a way to use these functions in Python.</description>
